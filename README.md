# Data Management Prototype

**Coursework Aim:** 
*To demonstrate understanding of the module subject matter and the ability to apply it, including critical analysis and judgement. This coursework is based on individual submissions. Design, Implement, Test, Report on a prototype data warehouse.* 
- Produce a single MS Word (doc/docx) format file containing all deliverables. 

 - Using Kimball’s Dimensional Modelling Technique design a suitable Star Schema for the specified data sets. 
- Then using either MS SQL Server with T-SQL or SSIS the necessary ETL operations and 4 query tasks (programming functionality) must be implemented. 
- Complete with a dashboard built utilising the 4 query tasks in Tableau or Power BI. 
- Finally, a brief 10 min video demo of Tasks 4,5 must be recorded using MS Teams. Provide URL to the video in your report… Ensure the tutor has access rights to view the video.
